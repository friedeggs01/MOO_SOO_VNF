DATA DESCRIPTION 
The given description outlines the structure of the dataset organized in folders named "topology_distribution_id." Each folder consists of three files: "input.txt," "request10.txt," "request20.txt," and "request30.txt."

#File input.txt
    The first line contains two integers, k and l, representing the quantity of VNFs and the maximum number of VNFs that can be deployed on a server node. (l is randomly chosen in the range [Ceil(T / |V_Server|), 2 * Ceil(T / |V_Server|)]).
    The next line contains an integer n, denoting the number of nodes.
    The following n lines describe each node on the graph with the format: id, delay, costServer. (If costServer >= 0, the node with id is a server, followed by T costVNF values corresponding to the cost of deploying VNFs f_1, f_2, ..., f_T at server node id. If costServer = -1, the node with id is a PNF).
    The costServer is randomly chosen in the range [5000, 10000], and costVNF is randomly chosen in the range [1000, 2000].
    The next line contains an integer m, indicating the number of edges.
    The subsequent m lines describe each edge in the format: u, v, delay (representing an edge connecting nodes u and v with a delay in the range [200, 500]).

#File requestX.txt (where X = 10, 20, or 30)
    The first line contains an integer Q, representing the number of requests.
    The next Q lines describe each request with the format: bandwith, memory, cpu, u, v, k, followed by k VNFs to be executed in order.
    Each request consumes bandwidth, memory, and CPU processing capacity, and it requires execution from node u to node v. Additionally, it specifies k VNFs to be executed in sequence.
